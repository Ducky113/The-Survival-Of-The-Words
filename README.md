# The-Survival-Of-The-Words
A small and simple Unity game with the purpose of helping me get better at game development.

 Thanks for looking this project up. The point of this Game is to help me get better at Unity all the
while making a fun game that I will be proud of.

 The story is an inspiration of a classic text based survival game I used to play when I was young and a Webtoon by the name of "The Room Of Swords".
 
 This game will be updated by me hopefully every week based on my free time but will recieve consistent updates so that ain't gooing to be a problem.
 
 So................................. ENJOY. 
 
 And thanks again :) .
 
 
 Made by a student who is waaaayyyyy to bored of school and just want's to do something fun in his free time.
